              <h4>Why Encapsulation Matters to Analysts</h4>
              <p>As user data travels down the stack, each layer appends metadata called a <strong>Header</strong>. An attacker can craft malicious headers at the network layer (e.g. IP Spoofing) or the transport layer (e.g. SYN Floods) to bypass firewalls or overwhelm hosts. Security monitoring devices like IDSs inspect these headers to detect malicious payloads.</p>

A hacker compromise on the public Wi-Fi subnet cannot easily pivot to the internal corporate database subnet if strict routing ACLs (Access Control Lists) exist between them.</p>
